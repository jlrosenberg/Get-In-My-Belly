This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
Installation:

First, we need to install rvm (ruby version manager)
```

\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

Next, we install the version of ruby that we want:
```
rvm install ruby-2.6.3
```

Next, set the default ruby version to that ruby installation:
```
rvm --default use 2.6.3
```

Next, install rails:
```
gem install rails -v 5.2.3
```
